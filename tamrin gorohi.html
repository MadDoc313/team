                Even though the founding/managing partners responsible for the management of each company established within Taha Holding are not
                shareholders in the parent company, they have joined the Taha Group family due to the partnership shares of the companies under their
                management. After Taha Tekstil started production of LC Waikiki for export, as the famous monkey t-shirt models of that
                period were in great demand in the domestic market, Turkey license of LC Waikiki was acquired by Taha Holding via Tema Tekstil which was
                established in 1991. Then, Turkey’s domestic market was penetrated via wholesale trading and corner dealers.

            <p class="p2">Founded by three partners of French origin in 1988, LC Waikiki started its commercial life as a wholesale brand.
                Established and registered in Paris, LC Waikiki attracted attention with its t-shirt and sweatshirt designs in the first place.
                With the separation of the two founding partners of the brand in time, LC Waikiki was passed to George Amouyal as the sole shareholder.
                Tema Tekstil, which is connected to Taha Group and is the producer as well as licensor of LC Waikiki in Turkey,
                bought the worldwide rights of the LC Waikiki brand in 1997.

            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p class="p2">
                After the purchase of all the rights of the brand, the name of Tema Tekstil, belonging to Taha Group, was changed to "LC Waikiki Retailing Services".
                The 7 percent share of the group was transferred to George Amouyal, from whom LC Waikiki's royalties were purchased. Although George Amouyal,
                of French origin, has not been actively involved in the management of LC Waikiki after the brand name transfer,
                he still holds 7 percent of our company.Taha Group, founded in 1988, bought LC Waikiki,
                which was born in Paris but grew in Istanbul, and brought it to its current level.
                The adventure of our brand has started with the capital support of the shareholders of Taha Dış Ticaret,
                which carried out import and export operations in the iron and steel sector of the period, and Taha Tekstil,
                a start-up in which Mustafa Küçük took responsibility as a founder/managing partner. Taha Tekstil, located in Zeytinburnu,
                on a small area of approximately 150 square meters on the ground floor of an apartment building,
                was established as a sample sewing and cutting workshop. Taha Tekstil,
                which exports clothing based on contract manufacturing, met with LC Waikiki via an intermediary marketer.
